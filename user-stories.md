# Dia TTS - Potential Feature User Stories (Out-of-the-Box)

Here are some potential user stories for new features that could be added to the Dia TTS Gradio application without requiring model retraining:

1.  **Dialogue Inspiration Mode:**
    *   **As a creative writer, I want an "Inspiration Mode" where I provide a short starting phrase or emotion, and the app generates several *different* short dialogue continuations using varied seeds/prompts, so I can get ideas or break writer's block for dialogue.**
    *   *Benefit:* Uses the model's generative capabilities for creative assistance beyond direct transcription.

2.  **Voice Palette Builder:**
    *   **As a user exploring voice characteristics, I want a "Voice Palette" tool where I can input the same short text multiple times, generate audio with different random seeds each time, and save the seeds associated with voices I like, so I can build a personal library of preferred random voice styles.**
    *   *Benefit:* Creates a workflow for discovering and cataloging voices generated by random seeds, addressing the "different voices every time" aspect.

3.  **Isolated Non-Verbal Sounds:**
    *   **As an audio producer, I want to input dialogue text and *separately* generate only the non-verbal sounds (like laughs, coughs specified in the text) as individual audio clips, so I can layer them precisely in my external editing software.**
    *   *Benefit:* Provides isolated non-verbal sound effects generated in the style of the model, useful for fine-grained audio editing.

4.  **Automatic Silence Trimmer:**
    *   **As a user cleaning up generated audio, I want a simple "Silence Trimmer" option that automatically removes leading/trailing silence or optionally shortens pauses *within* the generated audio based on a threshold, so the output is tighter without manual editing.**
    *   *Benefit:* Basic post-processing to improve the flow and reduce dead air.

5.  **Karaoke-Style Transcript Display:**
    *   **As a language learner or voice coach, I want to input text and have the audio generated *simultaneously* with a synchronized transcript display (karaoke-style highlighting), so I can visually track the speech and practice pronunciation or timing.**
    *   *Benefit:* Creates an interactive learning/practice tool.

6.  **Parameter Randomizer:**
    *   **As a user creating varied takes, I want a "Parameter Randomizer" button that suggests slightly different generation settings (temperature, top_p within reasonable bounds) based on the current settings, so I can easily explore variations without manually tweaking sliders each time.**
    *   *Benefit:* Encourages experimentation and discovery of different output styles.
